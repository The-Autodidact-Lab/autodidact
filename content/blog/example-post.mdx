This is an example blog post written in MDX format. You can use markdown syntax here, and it will be rendered with proper styling and a table of contents.

## Features

- **Markdown syntax** - Write posts in markdown
- **Table of Contents** - Automatically generated from headings
- **Frontmatter** - Add metadata like title, date, and author
- **Navigation** - Previous/Next post navigation

### Subheadings Work Too

You can use multiple levels of headings, and they'll all appear in the table of contents.
